# solidity-files
The collection of files here will just be an assortment of .sol files that I will upload in an attempt to assist with my learning process. 
The whole point of me doing this is as a self-motivating process so that I can get around to coding more things in solidity (and get used to programming with the language). 
These are not at all professional and they probably won't do any interesting stuff either
